# SoftUni-Fundamentals-Exercises
Here are all of my exercises during the Programing Fundamentals Course in SoftUni.

Exercise: Intro and Basic Syntax
Problems for exercises and homework for the "C# Fundamentals" course @ SoftUni

1.	Ages
Write a program that determines if a person is baby, child, teenager, adult or elder based on the given age. The boundaries are:
•	0-2 – baby
•	3-13 – child
•	14-19 – teenager
•	20-65 – adult
•	>= 66 – elder
•	All the values are inclusive.

2.	Divison
You will be given an integer, write a program which checks if the given integer is divisible by 2 or 3,  or 6, or 7, or 10 without a reminder. You should always take the bigger division:
•	If the number is divisible by both 2, 3, and 6, you should print the division by 6 only. 
•	If a number is divisible by 2 and 10, you should print the division by 10. 
If the number is not divisible by any of the given numbers, print "Not divisible". Otherwise, print "The number is divisible by {number}".

3.	Vacation
You will receive three lines from the console:
•	A count of people who are going on vacation.
•	Type of the group (Students, Business or Regular).
•	The day of the week which the group will stay on (Friday, Saturday or Sunday).
Based on the given information calculate how much the group will pay for the entire vacation. 
The price for a single person is as follows:
		Friday		Saturday	Sunday
Students	8.45		9.80		10.46
Business	10.90		15.60		16
Regular		15		20		22.50
There are also discounts based on some conditions:
•	For Students – if the group is 30 or more people, you should reduce the total price by 15%.
•	For Business – if the group is 100 or more people, 10 of the people stay for free.
•	For Regular – if the group is between 10 and 20  people (both inclusively), reduce the total price by 5%.
Note: You should reduce the prices in that EXACT order!
As an output print the final price which the group is going to pay in the format: 
"Total price: {price}" 
The price should be formatted to the second decimal point.

4.	Print and Sum
You will receive two whole numbers from the console representing the start and the end of a sequence of numbers. 
Your task is to print two lines:
•	On the first line, print all numbers from the start of the sequence to the end inclusive
•	On the second line, print the sum of the sequence in the format: "Sum: {sum}"
